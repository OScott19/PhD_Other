\section{Research Experience}


\begin{tabular}{ L{4cm} L{14cm} }
	\textsc{MRes} Imperial College, Jan '20 - Sept '20 & 
	 This project, titled ``Estimating phylogenetic diversity loss across major vertebrate clades" is the largest study looking into phylogenetically informed conservation prioritisation, and involved the implementation of a novel computational technique. I am currently in the process of using my results to create the first EDGE list (phylogenetically informed conservation priorisation list) for the ray-finned fish with the EDGE team at ZSL. \\&\\
	
	\textsc{Nijhout Lab}, \newline Duke University \newline Jan '15 - May '15 & Dr. Nijhout runs an entomology laboratory at Duke. We were investigating the role of hormones in caterpillar imaginal disk development. My role included: extracting blood samples; treating samples before analysis; isolate hormones using high performance liquid chromatography. \\&\\
	
	\textsc{Sherkin Island Marine Station}, \newline Co. Cork, RoI, \newline May '14 - Aug '14 & 
	This lab runs long-term rocky shore monitoring projects. I collected and analysed ecological data and lead a team of 7 to study the extent and abundance of the invasive seaweed Sargassum muticum. We discovered that S. muticum had spread significantly in the inter-tidal regions since the last survey. My responsibilities included collecting data; analyzing and identifying specimen (flora \& fauna); designing and running the S. muticum study. \\&\\
	
	
	\textsc{Indepent Research}, SIT Study Abroad, Zanzibar, Nov '13 - Dec '13 &
	I designed and carried out an investigation to test the hypothesis that sub-boulder communities of organisms would be similar in size and biodiversity irrespective of proximity to human activities. This involed designing the study; all data collection and analysis (using Mann – Whitney U test); and fauna identification.\\&\\
	\textsc{Indepent Research (x3)}, Duke University, Jan '13 - May '13 &
	Designed and implemented a study to empirically investigate the optimal design for wire antennae to collect data on the movements of swimmer crabs wearing RFID tags. The antenna design was used to track blue crabs in Lake Manamuskeet, NC. \newline 
	Conducted an experiment testing hermit crab response to visual and olfactory stimuli in relation to their size and shell fit. We observed a correlation between certain behaviours and the crabs’ shell fit. \newline
	Processed bulk photographic data of sediment to prepare for analysis to gauge the ecological impact of an oil spill on sediment formation and layers (data captured by a stationary “worm cam” positioned underwater).

	\textsc{Electron} \newline Oct '15 - Jun '19  & \textbf{Business Development manager}, prev. Communications Manager. \newline
	Electron is an energy-tech start-up specializing in blockchain-based digital infrastructure.\newline
	I started when the company was at a very early stage, and so my work evolved significantly throughout the time. 
	I was involved with every non-technical aspect of running and growing the business, included (but not limited to): communications (internal and external), fund raising, project managent, operations, business development, product definition, 'ways of working', and company culture.\newline 
	Towards the end of my time there I was Project Manager for a significant product development project with a South Korean parter; leading on internal and external comms; and a regular public speaker at industry events, such as RenewableUK's storage conference. \newline \\
	
	\textsc{Centre for Social Justice} \newline Jan '16 - Jun '16 & \textbf{Policy, research, events and campaigns assistant} \newline
	The CSJ is a think-tank that creates policies to alleviate the root causes of poverty. I worked with the research, campaign and events teams and my responsibilities included overseeing the release of two policy reports; organising report-launch and fundraising events; writing content for articles and blogs; and overhauling a key database.
